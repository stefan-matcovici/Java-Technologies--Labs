## JavaServer Faces
##### Create a Web application using JavaServer Faces technology, dedicated to optional course allocation. The JSF application (for now...) will have the following components:
* A Web page for defining optional packages. Each package is dedicated to a specific year of study and semester.
* A Web page for defining lecturers.
* A Web page for defining optional and compulsory courses. Each course should have the properties: name, year of study, semester, url, lecturer(s), number of study groups, etc. An optional courses must specify its package.

###### Notes:
* Use at least one non trivial JSF component, for example a data table, a tree, a dialog, etc.
* Use a relational database and JDBC in order to store and retrieve data. (PostgreSQL is recommended).
* It is recommended to use an Ajax-based JSF implementation: PrimeFaces, ICEFaces (ACE components), RichFaces, etc.
* Additional points will be given for using JSF technology beyond the "beginner" level (use custom converters, validators, "rich" components, i18n, etc.).
